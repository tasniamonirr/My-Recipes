    <p id="gcparagraph">A grilled cheese sandwich is a tried-and-true meal when you're either a broke college student, 
        someone who is too tired to make a 50 ingredient meal after a long day, or someone who simply yearns for the nostalgia.
    Whatever the case may be, you can never go wrong with a grilled cheesed sandwich. It only requires three ingredients can be made under 5 minutes.
You'll never want to go back to a regular grilled cheese ever again after trying this recipe. It takes just as much time and effort, so why not take it to a whole new level?
