    <p>A grilled cheese sandwich is a tried-and-true meal when you're either a broke college student, 
        someone who is too tired to make a 50 ingredient meal after a long day, or someone who simply yearns for the nostalgia.
    Whatever the case may be, you can never go wrong with a grilled cheesed sandwich. It only requires three ingredients can be made under 5 minutes.
You'll never want to go back to a regular grilled cheese ever again after trying this recipe. It takes just as much time and effort, so why not take it to a whole new level? </p>

</ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>

    <li>Lower heat and add parmesan to the butter-coated skillet</li>
    <li>Add bread slices and let them toast until the parmesan forms a gliden-brown crust on each slice</li>
    <li>Once the crust is formed, while still on the skillet, place gruyere slices on on bread slice and place the
        second slice of bread on top to form a sandwich</li>
    <li>Turn heat down to lowest setting and place a cover on the skillet</li>
    <li>Once the cheese has melted, the sandwich is ready to eat!</li>
